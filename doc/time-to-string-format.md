## Time

Largely copied from `date` command

```
%%    literal %
%a   abbreviated weekday name (e.g. Sun)
%A   full weekday name (e.g. Sunday)
%b   abbreviated month name (e.g. Jan)
%B   full month name (e.g. January)
%d   day of month (e.g. 01)
%D   

```

## Time slot

Same as above, but prefixed with `%s` instead of just `%` for start time, `%e` for end time
